<p class="mb-4 text-justify text-white">I'm <strong>Md. Serajus Salekin</strong>  from EWU Spring17 batch. Indroducing the new Web App "Class Schedule Maker". Some of you know that I have created a desktop app in Summer19 which was not so comfortable to use. So, now that has been converted to a Web App. This app will help you to create routines of all possible combinations according to course sections. However, this is not any of my course project. I was working with it from Fall19 semester. The intention was to learn something and help others. Finally, this end up here. Humble request to you guys, please feedback on this. Already I have fixed some errors but the final checking is on your hand. Thank You!</p>
